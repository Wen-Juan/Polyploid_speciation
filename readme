# A new biological species in the Mercurialis annua polyploid complex: functional divergence in inflorescence morphology, hybrid sterility and possible introgression

## This project is to assess the reproductive isolation between two hexaploid lineages in an annual plant Mercurialis annua, using common garden, phylogeny, and reciprocal crosses approaches.
